# Predicting mechanisms of action at genetic loci associated with discordant effects on type 2 diabetes and abdominal fat accumulation
 We used multiple analyses to show that five genetic loci associated with abdominal obesity are also associated with protection from type 2 diabetes. We predicted the effector genes and the tissues of action using colocalization and gene expression correlation analyses. We further predicted dynamic expression of these genes in adipogenesis, and roles for these genes in adipocytes.

Our results are available in eLife.
